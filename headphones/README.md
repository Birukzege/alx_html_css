In this project, I have focused on creating a responsive website using CSS and HTML. By utilizing CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques, I have aimed to ensure that the website looks great on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Feel free to explore the code and make any improvements or modifications as needed. I hope you enjoy browsing through the site as much as I enjoyed building it!
